# AirFrance_Kotlin
AirFrance mobile app built in Kotlin in 2022 for my third year of Computer Science Engineering School

The purpose of this project was to build a mobile app in Kotlin using the basics of the language and Jetpack Compose.
This app has been built using Android Studio software.

AirFrance app is a mobile app made for airplane pilots.
Indeed, before taking off, each pilot has to check in all information related to the aircraft weight (airplane weight, pilots weight, checked luggage weight, gas quantity...)

Thanks to this app, they are now able to select the aircraft they use and fill up all these information before their flight.
They can also know how much the flight costs per hour for the company depending on the plane they take off with.

I built two page in order to discover the navigation between different screens, even if there are no datas on the second page.

How is the app built ?

First, once you launched the app, you arrive on a feed with a bunch of different planes

By clicking the "Mass and balance" button, the pilot can get a lot of information about the plane.

As you can see above, Maximum Take Off Weight, Maximum Landing Weight, Current Weight as well as Allowed Weight are informed for the pilot.

By using the sliders (as you can see below), the pilot can then know how much weight he can still add before getting overweight.

Once the pilot is back on the main screen, he can also navigates to the weather window where no datas are available for the moment.
I added this screen to understand the way the navigation with a bottom bar works.

I hope you enjoyed this project I made for my Android class :)
